    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="section-subtitle">
      Strategy-driven professional combining 5+ years of SEO-led content execution with a growing foundation in Business Analytics.
    </p>

    <div class="card">

      <p>
        My work sits at the intersection of structured thinking, search performance, and measurable business growth. 
        Over the past five years, I have built scalable content ecosystems that improved visibility, 
        strengthened technical documentation frameworks, and aligned content architecture with product-led growth strategies.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-18">
        I approach problems systematically — breaking down complex technical information into structured assets 
        that serve both users and business objectives. Collaboration with engineering, product, and marketing teams 
        has allowed me to drive clarity, efficiency, and performance across digital touchpoints.
      </p>

      <ul class="experience-list">
        <li>Achieved 40% organic traffic growth through structured SEO strategy</li>
        <li>Built scalable documentation systems and knowledge frameworks</li>
        <li>Optimized content architecture for indexing, ranking, and performance</li>
        <li>Contributed to cross-functional growth initiatives across technology organizations</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-25">
        As I transition into Business Analytics, I am strengthening technical proficiency in SQL, Excel, and Tableau 
        to complement my strategic background. My long-term focus is clear: combining analytical insight 
        with execution capability to drive data-backed decision making.
